# SCRIPT-IN-PYTHON

# Scripting in Python Project

## Overview
This project, part of the CS 420 â€“ Advanced Programming Languages course, involves scripting in various languages to perform image processing tasks. The goal is to seamlessly integrate MATLAB, C, Haskell, Prolog, and Python scripts for a holistic approach to image manipulation.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are to perform operations such as thresholding, color inversion, and image rotation using different programming paradigms and integrate them through a Python wrapper script.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Installing Required Software
Ensure that the following software is installed and accessible via the command line:
- gcc for C
- ghc for Haskell
- swipl for Prolog
- MATLAB
- python3

### Task 1: C Program
- Read a sequence of numbers from the command line.
- Utilize dynamic memory allocation to store values.
- Apply thresholding and print pixel values accordingly.

### Task 2: Haskell Program
- Subtract elements in a list from 255.
- Implement IO() functionality for command-line execution.

### Task 3: Prolog Program
- Write a rule to reverse a list.
- Create a wrapper rule to read inputs, apply reverse, and output the result.

### Task 4: MATLAB Program 1
- Process a greyscale image.
- Convert pixel values to a 1D array and store in 'input.txt'.

### Task 5: MATLAB Program 2
- Read results of C, Haskell, and Prolog codes from text files.
- Reshape arrays and visualize as images.

### Task 6: Python Wrapper Program
- Run MATLAB Program 1 to generate input array.
- Call C Program for thresholding, Haskell Program for color flip, and Prolog Program for rotation.
- Save outputs in text files.
- Run MATLAB Program 2 to reconstruct and plot images.

### Task 7: CV Inclusion
Include this project on your CV immediately, highlighting the unique aspects of the project and its relevance to programming languages and image processing.

## Submission
- Submit a zip file containing all codes, with the Python code named 'wrapper.py'.
- Include a report with screenshots proving code functionality.
- Acknowledge references used.
